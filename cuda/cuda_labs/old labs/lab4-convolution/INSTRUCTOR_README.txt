This lab asks students to complete a floating-point "image" convolution.  
It is appropriate to assign this lab any time after the material of 
Chapter 5 in the textbook is covered.  Note that some students may benefit 
for a little bit of algorithmic instruction about loading in overlapping 
tiles (tiles with "halos") to have good locality, which is not directly 
covered in the textbook.    

The two zipped files contain folders for the assignment and solution.  
Inside the assignment folder is a LAB4-README.txt file describing the 
assignment, which you can modify to fit the assignment needs, submission 
instructions, and grading information relevant to your offering, 
if necessary.  Note that the zipped files are much larger than those for 
other assignments, since reasonably large test files are included.
